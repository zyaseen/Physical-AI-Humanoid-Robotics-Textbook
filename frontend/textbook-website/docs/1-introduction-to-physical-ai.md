# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence, focusing on the intersection of AI and physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI must contend with the complexities of the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI encompasses AI systems that interact with the physical world. These systems must process sensory information, make decisions, and execute actions in real-time while dealing with uncertainty, noise, and dynamic environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors
- **Planning**: Determining appropriate actions based on goals and constraints
- **Control**: Executing actions with precision and adaptability
- **Learning**: Improving performance through experience

## Applications

Physical AI has numerous applications across different fields, from robotics to autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, and beyond. Understanding these foundations is crucial for developing effective physical AI systems.
